🩺 Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning.

A deep learning model that detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The system classifies X-rays as Normal or Pneumonia and helps in early diagnosis through automated image analysis.

The model was trained on a labeled X-ray dataset and achieved over 92% accuracy. It is integrated with Streamlit for real-time predictions and Power BI for result visualization.
